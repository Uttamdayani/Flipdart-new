                <h2>Conditions for Returns</h2>
                <p>In order for the Goods to be eligible for a return, please make sure that:</p>

                    <li>The supply of Goods made to Your specifications or clearly personalized.</li>
                    <li>The supply of Goods which according to their nature are not suitable to be returned, deteriorate

                    <li>The supply of Goods which are not suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene
                        reasons and were unsealed after delivery.</li>
                    <li>The supply of Goods which are, after delivery, according to their nature, inseparably mixed with
                        other items.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We reserve the right to refuse returns of any merchandise that does not meet the above return
                    conditions in our sole discretion.</p>
                <p>Only regular priced Goods may be refunded. Unfortunately, Goods on sale cannot be refunded. This
                    exclusion may not apply to You if it is not permitted by applicable law.</p>

                <p>by email contact</p>
                <p>We cannot be held responsible for Goods damaged or lost in return shipment. Therefore, We recommend

                    will be mailed to You.</p>
                <p>If the Goods weren't marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the Order shipped to
                    themselves to give it to You later, We will send the refund to the gift giver.</p>
